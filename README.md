## 📂 Repository Structure

### 📘 [Algorithms and Data Structures I](./Algoritmo%20y%20Estructura%20de%20datos%201)

Focus: **Foundations of programming and basic algorithms using C++**

In this first stage, I learned:

- 🧠 **Algorithmic thinking** → Flowcharts and pseudocode
- 🧱 **C++ basics** → Variables, operators, input/output, conditionals, loops, functions
- 📄 **File handling** → Basic text file operations
- 🧩 **Structured programming** → Modular functions and organization

**Contents:**

- 📚 **Algorithm Classes** → Notes, solved exercises and class examples
- 🧰 **Dev C++ Projects** → Practical exercises and programs
- 📝 **Resolution Strategies (TP1-2)** → Problem-solving exercises
- 🔧 **Program Parts (TP3)** → Well-organized program examples

## 🚧 Integrative Project

The **Integrative Project** is the final and most important task in **Algorithms and Data Structures II**.

**Goal:**  
Build a complete and functional program in C++ to solve a real-world problem by applying everything learned during the course.

**Key features of the project:**

- 📂 **File I/O** → Reading and writing to store and manage data
- 🗂️ **Structures (structs)** → Organizing complex data
- 📊 **Arrays and Lists** → Managing dynamic collections
- 🧩 **Functions** → Modular and clean code
- 🖥️ **User Interface** → Menu-driven user interaction

This project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and implement full solutions using structured programming.
