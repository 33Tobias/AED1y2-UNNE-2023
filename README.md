# 📚 Algorithms and Data Structures I & II - C++ Projects

This repository contains exercises, assignments, theory notes, and university projects related to **Algorithms and Data Structures I & II**.

All the work was completed as part of my studies in Computer Science at **UNNE**.  
The goal is to showcase the learning journey — from basic algorithm design to solving complex problems using data structures.

## 📌 Repository Structure

### 📘 Algorithms and Data Structures I

In this first stage, the focus is on learning the **fundamentals of programming using C++**.  
The exercises aim to develop:

- **Algorithmic thinking**: Analyzing, designing, and representing solutions using flowcharts and pseudocode.
- **C++ basics**: Variables, data types, operators, input/output, conditionals, loops, and functions.
- **File handling**: Basic operations with text files.
- **Structured programming**: Modular design using functions.

**Content:**
- 📚 **Algorithm Classes** → Notes, exercises, and examples from lectures.
- 🧰 **Dev C++** → Practice projects and sample codes.
- 📝 **Resolution Strategies TP1-2** → Exercises applying simple structures to solve problems.
- 🔧 **Program Parts TP3** → Well-structured program examples.

### 📗 Algorithms and Data Structures II

In this advanced stage, the course focuses on **complex data structures** and solving higher-level problems with C++.  
Topics include:

- **Arrays and matrices**: Advanced usage and manipulation.
- **Structures (struct)**: Organizing and grouping data.
- **Lists, stacks, and queues (static and dynamic)**: Introduction to dynamic data structures.
- **Files**: Advanced file handling for data persistence.
- **Project design and development**: Applying all knowledge into a final integrative project.

**Content:**
- 🧪 **2nd Exam Prep** → Exercises and codes for the final exam.
- ✏️ **Drafts** → Experimental code and problem-solving ideas.
- 📖 **Theory** → Study materials and notes.
- 🏆 **Integrative Project** → Final comprehensive project.
- 📌 **Other Works** → Additional exercises and side projects.

### 🚧 Integrative Project

The **Integrative Project** is the final assignment for **Algorithms and Data Structures II**.  
The objective is to build a complete and functional program in C++ that solves a real-world problem by applying all the knowledge from the course.

The project includes:

- 📂 **File reading and writing** for data storage.
- 🗂️ **Structures (structs)** to organize information.
- 📊 **Arrays and lists** to manage data collections.
- 🧩 **Functions** to modularize and structure the code.
- 🖥️ **User interaction** via menus and options.

This project showcases the ability to design and implement complete and efficient solutions using structured programming in C++.
